      <p>My name is Usman Jamil, and I am from Pakistan. I have been leaving in Georgia since 2010. I like playing and watching cricket. In summer I and my friends usually go on the weekends to play cricket. This homework was my first experience with CSS and it was not good.</p>
      <p>I am also doing CS from Kennesaw state university, and I am in my final year. I came to this boot camp to increase my coding expertise and to increase my knowledge of web development. I have enjoyed the class so far but homework takes a lot of time to finish.</p>
